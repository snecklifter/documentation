<h1 id="ukcloud-for-microsoft-azure-service-scope">UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Service Scope</h1>

<h2 id="about-this-document">About this document</h2>
<p>This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service.</p>
<h2 id="about-ukcloud-for-microsoft-azure">About UKCloud for Microsoft Azure</h2>
<p>UKCloud for Microsoft Azure harnesses the innovation of Microsoft's Azure Stack Hub platform to deliver Microsoft Azure services from UKCloud's award-winning government-grade multi-cloud environment, addressing the security, service, connectivity and diversity requirements of UK Public Sector organisations and their industry partners.</p>
<p>As a Microsoft cloud service provider (CSP), UKCloud can also manage and support customers in their utilisation of Microsoft Azure public, making UKCloud the one-stop partner for all your Microsoft Azure requirements.</p>
<h2 id="service-delivery-options">Service delivery options</h2>
<p>UKCloud can deliver an Azure service using either our own Azure Stack Hub from the UKCloud platform, from the Azure public service or a combination of the two. While the functionality and tooling are very similar for both options, there are some differences, including the process of assigning agreements, billing and responsibilities. For clarity, the following are specific to each delivery option.</p>
<h2 id="ukcloud-azure-stack-hub">UKCloud Azure Stack Hub</h2>
<p>This service is provisioned from the UKCloud platform, and is owned, maintained and supported by UKCloud as with all other UKCloud technology stacks.</p>
<p>Once a purchase order is received, within 4 hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal and the Getting Started Guide.</p>
<p>We've created several articles, guides and FAQs to help you get up and running quickly and easily. These are available within our Knowledge Centre.</p>
<p>UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs.</p>
<h3 id="azure-stack-hub-service-management">Azure Stack Hub service management</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>API. Enables you to programmatically interact with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure resources.</p>
</li>
<li><p>UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Provides access to pre-created images, which help speed up application delivery.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Azure Resource Manager. Enables you to write templates to deploy, update and delete UKCloud for Microsoft Azure resources in a single coordinated operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>VM Extensions. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure supports virtual machine extensions that provide post deployment management for automation (for example, PowerShell DSC).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="azure-stack-hub-service-options">Azure Stack Hub service options</h3>
<p>You can build a tailored solution to meet your requirements by mixing and matching service options. The choice does not lock you to one service or size, enabling you to scale resources up or down as your requirements change.</p>
<p>Azure Stack Hub is available in two models:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pay as you go (PAYG). Customers of the PAYG model can consume Microsoft Azure IaaS services and services built on Azure IaaS templates like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Private deployment. Customers with private Azure Stack environments can also enable PaaS services such as Azure Functions, SQL and MYSQL services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The options below are all currently available within the PAYG service. For a full list of Azure Stack Hub services, see <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/azure-stack/keyfeatures/">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="iaas-compute">IaaS compute</h4>
<p>Virtual machines (VMs) provide the basic building blocks of compute resource within UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Each standard machine has a pre-allocated number of vCPUs, amount of memory and a temporary disk. The available sizes and families of VMs are continually increasing. Broadly, the following machine families are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basic and Standard A-Series. CPU performance and memory configurations best suited for entry level workloads like development and test.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Standard D-Series and DS-Series. Optimised CPU-to-memory configuration, making them suitable for most general-purpose applications. A subset of the D-series VMs also support higher memory per CPU making them suitable for applications that require higher amounts of memory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Basic and Standard F-series. Optimised for CPU-intensive workloads so have a higher CPU to memory configurations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the full list of supported virtual machine sizes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-sizes">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can deploy VMs using the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal and other tooling.</p>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>Each VM contains a temporary disk. The temporary disk provides short-term storage for applications and processes and is intended to only store data such as page or swap files. Data on the temporary disk may be lost during a maintenance event or when you redeploy a VM.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="storage-options">Storage options</h4>
<p>There are several ways in which storage can be addressed in UKCloud for Microsoft Azure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Azure Blob Storage (Page). Page blobs are optimised for representing IaaS disks and supporting random writes that are up to 1 TB in size. An Azure Stack Hub virtual machine attached IaaS disk is a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) stored as a page blob. At present only unmanaged disks can be offered in the service.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Azure Blob Storage (Block). Block blobs (generically known as object storage) are optimised for streaming and storing cloud objects, and are a good choice for storing documents, media files, backups, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Azure Blob Storage (Append). Append blobs are optimised for append operations. An append blob can be updated only by adding a new block to the end. Append blobs are a good choice for scenarios such as logging, where new data needs to be written only to the end of the blob.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Azure Queue Storage. In designing applications for scale, application components are often decoupled, so that they can scale independently. Queue storage provides a reliable messaging solution for asynchronous communication between application components, whether they're running in the cloud, on the desktop, on an on-premises server, or on a mobile device. Queue storage also supports managing asynchronous tasks and building process workflows. A storage account can contain any number of queues, and a queue can contain any number of messages, up to the capacity limit of the storage account. Individual messages may be up to 64 KB in size.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Azure Table Storage. Table storage is Microsoft's NoSQL key/attribute store - it has a schemaless design, making it different from traditional relational databases. With a schemaless data store, it's easy to adapt your data as the needs of your application evolve. Table storage is easy to use, so developers can create applications quickly. Table storage is a key-attribute store, which means that every value in a table is stored with a typed property name. The property name can be used for filtering and specifying selection criteria. A collection of properties and their values comprise an entity. Since table storage is schemaless, two entities in the same table can contain different collections of properties, and those properties can be of different types. You can use table storage to store flexible datasets, such as user data for web applications, address books, device information and any other type of metadata that your service requires. For today's internet-based applications, NoSQL databases like table storage offer a popular alternative to traditional relational databases. A storage account can contain any number of tables, and a table can contain any number of entities, up to the capacity limit of the storage account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>All storage in Azure Stack Hub is taken from a common pool. When designing your service for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, consider the best usage of your storage. For example, if you have a large object storage requirement, consider using UKCloud's Cloud Storage service as part of your solution.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="network">Network</h4>
<p>UKCloud manages the physical firewalls that face public and secure networks.</p>
<p>You can deploy multiple gateway devices and configure the following using either the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal or API:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Virtual networks. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure enables you to configure virtual private clouds and create and manage your private address space within Azure. You can configure this via the UI, API or other tooling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Load balancers (IPv4 only). Deploy basic load balancers VPN gateway across your Azure environments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>VPN gateway. Use the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Routing. Configure basic custom defined routing on virtual networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Internet-facing solutions have 10 usable public IP addresses. You can ask for additional public IP addresses by raising a Service Request via the <a href="https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti">My Calls</a> section of the UKCloud Portal. We reserve the right to decline the request if you have spare capacity in your existing deployment.</p>
<h4 id="advanced-features">Advanced features</h4>
<h5 id="key-vault">Key Vault</h5>
<p>UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides cryptographic secret storage for applications and services. You can consume these services via both portal and API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kv-intro">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="protection-options">Protection options</h4>
<p>You're responsible for designing your own disaster recovery and backup solutions as part of your adoption of UKCloud for Microsoft Azure.</p>
<h3 id="azure-stack-hub-service-availability">Azure Stack Hub service availability</h3>
<p>The availability of your virtual machines in UKCloud for Microsoft Azure follows the same principles of the Microsoft Azure Public Cloud, where customers achieve a higher service level availability based on how they architect the solution.</p>
<p>The service levels are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>99.90% (a single VM deployed as a single instance deployed inside a zone)</p>
</li>
<li><p>99.95% (a single VM with two instances deployed inside a zone)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>To qualify for the higher service level, we advise that you use on-platform tools, like availability sets, that ensure your VMs are provisioned to different hardware in the zone.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="azure-stack-hub-service-background">Azure Stack Hub service background</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>VMs are fully provisioned.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The system is configured to automatically balance resources, so your VMs may be moved between physical hosts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can specify the site where you would like to have your service provisioned (from sites where UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is available).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service is updated regularly with the latest code release from Microsoft. Typically, this is once a month and notified via the <a href="https://status.ukcloud.com/">UKCloud service status page</a> and the <a href="https://portal.ukcloud.com">UKCloud Portal</a>. UKCloud aim to be within two updates from Microsoft, however, we will control the release of the patches into the live service.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Through the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal you can use availability sets so that VMs do not run on the same physical host.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can make additional configurations inside a VM (such as acting as a secondary hypervisor or implementing third-party software technologies), however, we do not support these customer implementations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="azure-stack-hub-marketplace">Azure Stack Hub Marketplace</h3>
<p>UKCloud for Microsoft Azure includes access to a local version of the Azure Marketplace. The Marketplace contains a collection of services, applications and resources customised for Azure Stack Hub that you can deploy in your environment. Every Marketplace item has:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An Azure Resource Manager template for resource provisioning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Metadata, such as strings, icons, and other marketing collateral</p>
</li>
<li><p>Formatting information to display the item in the portal</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've pre-populated the Marketplace with a variety of images and templates that have been identified as the most useful services. You can request for additional resources to be added, provided they are approved for use on Azure Stack Hub. You can find a full list of available items <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-marketplace-azure-items">here</a>.</p>
<p>You're responsible for ensuring that you have appropriate licensing and support in place for any item deployed from the Marketplace not licensed by UKCloud.</p>
<h3 id="azure-stack-hub-licensing">Azure Stack Hub Licensing</h3>
<p>We can provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Operating system licensing for Microsoft</p>
</li>
<li><p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux licensing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the latest available licences, check the <a href="azs-sd.html"><em>Service Definition</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can bring your own licensing for Red Hat and certain Microsoft application licensing under Microsoft Mobility using software assurance. If you're providing your own licensing, you should inform UKCloud (by raising a Service Request via the <a href="https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti">My Calls</a> section of the UKCloud Portal) for a retrospective discount.</p>
<p>For non-UKCloud issued software, you must obey the licensing requirements of the software provider. This includes being aware of any constraints around using the software in a virtualised environment.</p>
<h3 id="azure-stack-hub-vm-server-images">Azure Stack Hub VM server images</h3>
<p>We provide base VM images for the operating systems for which we provide licensing, along with images for various free Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, CentOS and Debian). You can access these from the Marketplace available within the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal.</p>
<p>You can use your own images for non-Windows and RHEL services, where licensing stipulates that to use the VM on our platform it must be licensed (and reported back to the software vendor) by UKCloud.</p>
<p>We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service.</p>
<h3 id="azure-stack-hub-protective-monitoring">Azure Stack Hub protective monitoring</h3>
<p>We've implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated security domains at the hypervisor level and below.</p>
<p>We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM). It's your responsibility to act at this level.</p>
<p>In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It's your responsibility to report similar incidents to us.</p>
<h3 id="azure-stack-hub-platform-management">Azure Stack Hub platform management</h3>
