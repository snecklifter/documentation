# Auto Scaling for UKCloud for OpenStack

By using pre-defined rules that consider factors such as CPU or memory usage, you can configure Orchestration (HEAT) to automatically add and remove additional instances as needed.

The following Red Hat document describes how to automatically scale out your compute instances in response to heavy system usage.
