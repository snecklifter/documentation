# How to manage UKCloud for OpenStack accounts in the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

This article shows how UKCloud Portal administrators can use the Portal to create user accounts for UKCloud for OpenStack and set access permissions.

### Intended audience

To set OpenStack account permissions, you must be a UKCloud Portal administrator for the account that includes the OpenStack project.

## Prerequisites

To give a user access to an OpenStack project, they must have a user account in the UKCloud Portal. For detailed steps for how to create a new Portal user, see [*How to create a new user in the UKCloud Portal*](../portal/ptl-how-create-users.md).

> [!TIP]
> When creating a Portal account for an OpenStack user, you may first need to switch to the account that contains the OpenStack project.

> [!NOTE]
> After creating a new Portal user account, there may be a delay of a few minutes while the new user's information is synchronised around the system.

## Assigning and revoking OpenStack permissions

To enable a user to work with an OpenStack project you must assign them permission to access the project. You can also revoke permission to remove a user's OpenStack access.

To assign or revoke OpenStack permissions:

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal

    For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal**](../portal/ptl-gs.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must log in as a Portal administrator for the account that includes the OpenStack project.

2. If necessary, switch to the account that includes the OpenStack project.

3. In the Portal navigation panel, expand **Contacts** option and select **All Contacts**.

    Deselect the check box to revoke access permissions.

To access OpenStack:

1. In the UKCloud Portal, if necessary, switch to the account that includes the OpenStack project.

2. In the Portal navigation panel, select **OpenStack Cloud**.
