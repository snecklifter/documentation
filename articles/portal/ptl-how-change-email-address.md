# How to change your email address in the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

If you need to change the email address you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal, you'll need to raise a Service Request to ensure that the correct permissions are associated with the new email address and single sign-on continues to work correctly.

## Changing your email address

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal using your old email address.

    For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md).

2. Use My Calls to raise a Service Request.

    > [!TIP]
    > Use the **Generic Service Request** template.

    For more detailed instructions, see [*How to use My Calls to raise and monitor support tickets*](ptl-how-use-my-calls.md).

3. Enter the details as required, including:

    - Your new email address

    - The name of the user account (if you have multiple accounts for the same email address)

4. A member of UKCloud Support will pick up the ticket and make the necessary changes.

5. When the change has been completed, a member of UKCloud Support will contact you, on the email address you used to raise the ticket, to verify that the change was successful.

6. Log in to the Portal using your new email address and verify that you can access My Calls.

7. Confirm with UKCloud Support that the update has been successful.

8. If you encounter any problems, contact UKCloud Support. If you can't access My Calls, you can call UKCloud Support on 01252 303 300 (select option 2).
