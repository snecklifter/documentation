# How to use My Calls to raise and monitor support tickets

## Overview

My Calls is your oneâ€‘stop place, accessed via the UKCloud Portal, to raise new support tickets (incidents and requests) with UKCloud and monitor existing tickets.

My Calls covers the ITIL standards of:

- Raising faults and outages (incidents)

- Raising service requests, for example, to request service or system information, restore backups or request logs

### Intended audience

- If you have the *My Tickets* permission, you can create new support tickets and view and update the tickets that you've created

- If you have the *Account Tickets* or *My Calls Admin* permission, you can create new support tickets and view and update any ticket raised (including those raised by other users)

## Accessing an existing support ticket

After raising a support ticket, you can view the ticket to monitor progress, add more information, add attachments, close or cancel the ticket.

In My Calls, on the **My Tickets** tab, find the ticket you want to view by:

- Browsing through the list of tickets. By default, tickets are listed with the newest first.

- Use the search field to find your ticket.

- Use filter options to find tickets with a particular status or date. You can also filter by incident and request ticket types.
