# How to raise and escalate support tickets (incidents and service requests) with customer support

## Overview

This article provides information about how the support process works at UKCloud and what to expect when you raise a support ticket (incident or service request), including support hours, target response times and the escalation process.

- Incidents - for ongoing faults and outages

- Service requests - for requesting new services, changes to existing services, system information, restoring backups or requesting logs

> [!TIP]
> Before raising an incident, you can check the [UKCloud Service Status page](https://status.ukcloud.com/) to see if there's a known issue on the platform that we're already working on.

## Incident priorities

> [!NOTE]
> Incidents are for ongoing faults and outages. If you're raising a ticket against an incident that has been resolved, raise a service request instead.

&nbsp; | &nbsp;
-----------|-----------
**Priority 1** | **Priority 2**
Service is currently experiencing a significant outage or disruption to multiple users or locations<br><br>Service has a confirmed or suspected compromise, loss or unavailability of data | Service is available but is currently experiencing degradation or restrictions for multiple users or locations
**Priority 3** | **Priority 4**
Service is currently experiencing a failure or degradation of redundant or non-critical components<br><br>Service is currently experiencing failure of a shared service, where alternative services remain available, or disruption for single users | Service is currently affected by documented housekeeping activities<br><br>Service is currently affected by administration-related requirements or an uncategorised incident

## Contacting UKCloud

### Service hours

Service support hours are:

Ticket priority | Support hours
----------------|--------------
**P1 incident** | 24 x 7
**P2 to P4 incident** | Monday to Friday from 0800 to 2000 (excluding bank holidays)
**Service requests (all)** | Monday to Friday from 0800 to 2000 (excluding bank holidays)

### During service hours

Customers should ensure they complete basic checks before contacting UKCloud, and the individual contacting UKCloud should have sufficient knowledge to be able to respond to requests for information and assistance.

Methods for contacting The UKCloud team are as follows:

- UKCloud Portal (Assured) - <https://portal.ukcloud.com/>

- UKCloud Portal (Elevated) - Contact your Portal administrator or Service Delivery Manager (SDM)

- Telephone - 01252 303 300 (select option 2)

The UKCloud Portal is the preferred approach for raising requests and issues with UKCloud. For information about raising requests, see [*How to use My Calls in the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-how-use-my-calls.md).

Customers are asked to provide the following:

- Company details and contact details

- A detailed description of the problem or issue

- Relevant log files, configuration files and supporting information

- Captured screen shots

Customers can contact Support via email at <support@ukcloud.com>, although, as we are unable to carry out user verification via this method, email should not be used to raise support tickets.

## Incident and service request logging and assignment process

### First contact

Initial contact should always be via the UKCloud Portal unless this is unavailable or the customer is experiencing an outage and would like immediate support, in which case contact should be via phone.

### Triage

All requests and incidents are sent to triage for initial review to assess that sufficient details have been provided, for example:

- Correct priority/severity

- Contact details have been provided

- Clear description of issue or request is included

Where details are missing, we'll seek clarification.

### Assignment

Tickets are assigned to a Cloud Support Engineer (CSE) who will engage with the customer to provide assistance.

## Customer service targets

Your experience is important to us. We measure our performance against service targets across our customers to ensure that we provide you with a service you can trust.

Ticket priority | Initial response target | Resolution target
----------------|-------------------------|------------------
**P1 incident** | 15 minutes | 90% in 12 hours
**P2 incident** | 1 hour | 90% in 24 hours
**P3 incident** | 1 hour | 90% in 5 days
**P4 incident** | 1 hour | 90% in 5 days
**Service request** | 1 hour | 2 days (standard pre-approved requests)

## Viewing tickets and service updates

All incidents and service requests are visible within the UKCloud Portal under [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) (for more information, see [*How to use My Calls in the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-how-use-my-calls.md)). The Portal also provides notification of upcoming changes.

During a Major Incident, updates are published to the Service Status page: <https://status.ukcloud.com/>.

## Escalation

For onboarding issues, contact your allocated SDM.

To escalate an incident or service request, contact the Support Team (by phone in the first instance):

- Tel: 01252 303 300 (option 2)

- Email: <escalations@ukcloud.com> (monitored 24 x 7)

For wider service issues, contact your SDM during standard office hours.
