## Changes to APIs

VMware Cloud Director 10.1 supports the VMware Cloud Director API version 34.0 (see <https://code.vmware.com/apis/912/vmware-cloud-director>). For information about the changes to the VMware Cloud Director API for this version, see [VMare Cloud Director API Schema Differences](https://code.vmware.com/apis/912/vmware-cloud-director/doc/diff/index.html).

VMware Cloud Director 10.1 is the last release of VMware Cloud Director to support vCloud Director API 30.0. The 30.0 and 31.0 versions of the API are deprecated in this release and will not be supported in future releases.

The following API versions are still available:

- 30.0 (deprecated)

- 31.0 (deprecated)

- 32.0

- 33.0

- 34.0

### Sandbox for testing vCloud API

UKCloud provides sandboxes to enable you to test the next versions of the VMware Cloud Director API so that you can prepare for VMware Cloud Director upgrades. Our latest sandbox (<https://vcd.latest.ukcloud.com/cloud/>) has been upgraded to vCloud Director 10.1.

To gain access to the 10.1 sandbox, raise a Service Request via My Calls on the UKCloud Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Some VMware Cloud Director features may be available in the sandbox that will not be enabled in UKCloud for VMware after the 10.1 upgrade. If there's a 10.1 feature that you're particularly interested in, contact your Service Delivery Manager to register interest so that we can consider it for our roadmap.
