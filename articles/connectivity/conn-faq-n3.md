# N3 connectivity FAQs

## General

### Can I still connect to N3 on UKCloud?

N3 is no longer generally available on UKCloud. HSCN is the replacement for N3 and HSCN connectivity is now available on UKCloud.

For more information about connecting to HSCN, please see the [*HSCN connectivity FAQs*](conn-faq-hscn.md).
